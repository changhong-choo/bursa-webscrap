# Bursa Malaysia WebScrap
Simple program to extract data from Bursa Malaysia website using [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) in [Python](https://www.python.org/). 

## Description
The program is able to extract equities and indices daily movements in [Bursa Malaysia](https://www.bursamalaysia.com/) and save the data in a csv file. As the project is mainly for practise purpose, the equities information extracted is only from the [Main Market](https://www.bursamalaysia.com/market_information/equities_prices?keyword=&top_stock=top_active&board=MAIN-MKT&alphabetical=&sector=&sub_sector=). Run both the .py file and the data will be stored in separate csv files in your working directory.

## Further improvement
1. Integrate both programs into one
2. Automate the daily program
