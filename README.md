# Bursa Malaysia WebScrap
Simple program to extract data from Bursa Malaysia website using [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

## Description
This is a project for myself to practice Python and Power BI. Currently the program is able to extract equities daily movement from Main Market only. I would like to expand the program to have a overall picture of Malaysia's stock market which includes extracting additional data and present the data in Power BI dashboard.
